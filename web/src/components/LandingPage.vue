        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <!--
            Things I want to get across:
            - What is an incentive system?
            - Typical implementation: central database. Bad for privacy.
            - This project: storing stuff with user. Privacy (give examples what the store learns and doesn't learn). Yay!
            - Call to action: install app, scan barcodes, earn virtual rewards. All secured by cool crypto (name building blocks).
            - Tease that you can attempt to double-spend, see those mechanisms in action. 
            - Link to further resources (papers, cptml, sfb, github, cuk)
        -->
